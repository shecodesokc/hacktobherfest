# What is Hacktoberfest?
It's a global challenge to create 4 pull requests on GitHub during the month of October.

# Do I get a t-shirt?
Unfortunately, not anymore - just a digital badge and bragging rights!

# What is a pull request?
Itâ€™s an action you take on GitHub when you want someone to pull your changes into their code.

# How do I sign up?
Go to [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/) to register!

# What should I work on?
There are lots of issues at [github.com/shecodesokc/hacktober-broken-repo](https://github.com/shecodesokc/hacktober-broken-repo)

# What if I need help?
Just ask! Someone here can probably get you unstuck, or you can try asking in the #hacktoberfest or #git-help Slack channels.
